# Number-Guessing-Game
 This C++ project is a **Number Guessing Game** where the program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100. The user is asked to guess the number, and feedback is provided if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The program tracks the number of attempts until the correct guess is made.
